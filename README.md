INFO:
This tool will help you with analysing issues with Defender for Endpoint locally on your endpoint. The script will centralize in one view the security configuration, logs files, update
and give you access to the Performance Analyzer.

This is the first version of the tool. Bugs, enhancements and reports can be submitted at my github.

Prerequisites: 

Script need to run as admin to view all settings.
